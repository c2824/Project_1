# Project_1
Jetson Nano tests. Conducted for learning and the observation of AI.
Provided in my detailed video (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1O7kjKA-4ObZ94ZGNBm3O7jyiFtzmjzWW/view?usp=sharing) my mission and goal is to ascribe the fundamentals of AI classification and learning within the realm of aquatic marine life. The purpose of using this mechanical tool is for the classification and categorization of different marine life, particularly fish and mammals. What my project provides is a label to a particular image given to the trained machine as it was then processed using preceeding images resembling the subjected image. Carrying this process and procedure through can allows scientists and researchers to better classify the unique and diverse nature of fish and mammal sea creatures. This is not only beneifcial for identifying different earthly ocean species but to potentially accurately decrypt marine life on other worlds for the better of understanding and studying them.
